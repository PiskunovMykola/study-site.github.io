			<div id="3"><strong> Crests and colours </strong> </div>
			<div id="3"> Crests</div>
			<p class="p3">The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, "MCF" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt. The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle. The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title "Real Madrid," meaning "Royal." Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.</p>
			<div id="3a"> Colours</div>
			<p class="p4">
				Real Madrid's traditional colors are white and dark blue. The club's iconic all-white home kit has been its signature look since its inception. This choice of colors was inspired by the white shirt and dark blue shorts of the founding members' alma mater, Institución Libre de Enseñanza. Over the years, various designs and accents have been incorporated into the kits, but the predominant theme remains white, symbolizing purity and elegance, while dark blue often serves as an accent color. The club's away kits have featured various colors and designs, but white remains the primary color in many of them. These colors have become emblematic of Real Madrid's rich history and success on the football pitch.</p>
				<div id="3b"> Kit deal</div>
			<p class="p5">Real Madrid's kit deal is a significant aspect of the club's financial and branding strategy. As of my last update, Real Madrid had a lucrative partnership with adidas as their official kit supplier. The deal, one of the most valuable in football, provides the club with substantial revenue and ensures that Real Madrid's players wear adidas-branded jerseys, shorts, and socks during matches. Additionally, the partnership often involves collaborative efforts in marketing and product development, leveraging the global reach and prestige of both the club and the sportswear brand. Such kit deals contribute significantly to Real Madrid's financial stability and help maintain its status as one of the world's most prominent football clubs. However, please note that specific details of the deal, including its duration and financial terms, may vary and should be verified for the most current information.</p>

<p> Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time.Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency of the club (2000–2006 and 2009–2018), however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Galácticos legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy.On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record breaking £80 million (€94 million);he became both the club and history's all-time top goalscorer. Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo and Jude Bellingham</p>

<p> Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (42), tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[30] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18. In May 2022, they won a record-extending 14th Champions League title (the fifth in nine seasons), recognised as such by the Guinness World Records.Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.As of March 2023, Real Madrid are ranked fifth in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall.</p>
